systematic strategy to apply for solving problems:
    1. State the problem clearly. identify the inputs and outputs formats
    2. come up with some example inputs and outputs. try tocover all possible edge cases.
    3. come up with the correct solution for the problem. state it in plain english.
    4. impliment the solutions and test it using example inputs. fix bugs, if any. 
    5. analyse the algorithms complexity and identify the ineffiencies, if any.
    6. apply the right technique to overcome the inefficieny. repeart step 3 to 6

    inputs:
        1. cards: a list of numbers sorted in decreasing order.e.g [13,11,10,7,4,3,1,0]
        2. query: a number's position to be determined
    
    output:
        3. position: the position of query in the list cards. e.g 3 in the above case(counting from 0)
